   <strong>This project is being developed for educational purposes</strong>.
 </p>
 <p>
   Considering my learnings in the web development course I'm taking, I decided to combine my passion for music with the desire to develop a project on my own and created Luiz Henrique's Spotify Experience.
 </p>
 
 <br>

<p>
  Luiz Henrique's Spotify Experience is a website (with easter eggs, but don't tell anyone) where you can browse my playlists, my favorite songs and my favorite musical genres, as well as listen to good music.
</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>
   This project, so far, uses HTML, CSS and the song and playlist codes that Spotify offers through its application. My objective is to test my skills by working with technologies that I like and am learning.
 </p>

 <p>
   I used Spotify's own font and colors so that the project was as accurate as possible.
